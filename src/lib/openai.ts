It is very important that if more than one question is asked to be generated in one request, then provide enough variety of questions to cover all major aspects of the topic.Please do not send variations of the same question.

üéØ YOUTUBE SHORTS OPTIMIZATION:
- Question must be THEORETICAL only (NO calculations, NO math, NO numbers)
- Quick to read and answer (5-8 seconds)
- Engaging and fun - like trivia or interesting facts
- Can include surprising general knowledge
- Keep it conversational and relatable

üìù QUESTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Difficulty: ${difficulty}
- IMPORTANT: CBSE/NEET/JEE syllabus-based but made interesting
- Test CONCEPTUAL understanding, not memorization
- Question text: 60-80 characters max (fits on screen)
- 4 options: Clear, distinct, plausible answers
- Only ONE correct answer
- Brief explanation: 1-2 sentences, engaging and easy to understand

üé® MAKE IT ENGAGING:
- Use everyday examples when possible
- Add interesting twists or fun facts
- Avoid dry, textbook-style questions
- Make viewers think "Oh, I know this!" or "That's cool!"

‚ùå AVOID:
- Any calculations or numerical answers
- Complex scientific terms (explain simply)
- Boring definitions or classifications
- Questions that require deep analysis
- Avoid sending variations of the same question like in this manner:
  Variation 1: Why is hydrogen called the 'universal fuel' in stars?
  Variation 2: Why is hydrogen called the 'fuel of the future'?

‚úÖ EXAMPLES OF GOOD QUESTIONS:
- "What makes leaves green?" (not "Calculate chlorophyll absorption")
- "Why do we see rainbows?" (not "Solve for prism refraction angle")
- "Which planet has rings?" (not "Calculate orbital mechanics")

You MUST respond with valid JSON in exactly this format:
{
  "text": "What makes plants green and helps them make food?",
  "optionA": "Sunlight",
  "optionB": "Chlorophyll",
  "optionC": "Water",
  "optionD": "Soil",
  "correctAnswer": "B",
  "explanation": "Chlorophyll is the green pigment in plants that captures sunlight to make food through photosynthesis!"
}

Do not include any other text, markdown, or formatting. Just the JSON object.`
